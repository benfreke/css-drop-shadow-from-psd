css-drop-shadow-from-psd
========================

This little script allows you to insert values from a PSD drop-shadow, and output CSS for it.

I got sick of guessing what the right values are so I decided to create some javascript to convert it automatically for me. 

Very much inspired by http://css3generator.com/
