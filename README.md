css-drop-shadow-from-psd
========================

Some javascript functions to enable conversion of a PSD drop shadow to CSS3 commands. 

I got sick of guessing what the right values are so I decided to create some javascript to convert it automatically for me. 

Very much inspired by http://css3generator.com/
